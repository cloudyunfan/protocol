%Input:
%   1.CHNbefore_leng : the former slots length.
%   2.CHNafter_leng : the latter slots length.
%   3.slotNO : NO. of allocated slots of the node.
%   4.CHN_sta_ini : temperal variable to record every INITIAL state in a superframe
%   5.Pu : the  transition probability from the bad state to the good state.(up:0->1)
%   6.Pd : the  transition probability from the good state to the bad state.(down:1->0)
%   7.E_nodebuf: energy buff of node n
%   8.B_nodebuf: packet buff of node n
%Output:
%   1.CHN_sta_f : the  INITIAL state  after the pktsend.
%   2.ps : the NO. of successful packets
%   3.pl : the NO. of lossed packets.
%   4.outcome :  last slot state of current node
%   5.CHN_sta_f : the last state after the superframe.
%   6.E_ex: energy exhost totaly
%   7.Succ_TX_ind： record the time when node send pkt successfully after
%   thie superframe
% 	8.E_nodebuf：energy buff of node n
%   9.B_nodebuf:packet buff of node n
%   10.E_overflow_t:能量溢出
%     11.E_EH：能量采集
%*******与pktsend的区别是多返回一个平均成功发包间隔Interval_avg***********
